        <h2>Web Desing</h2>
        <p>A web designer works on the appearance, layout, and, in some cases, content of a website. Appearance, for
          instance,
          relates to the colors, font, and images used. Layout refers to how information is structured and categorized.
          A good
          web design is easy to use, aesthetically pleasing, and suits the user group and brand of the website. Many
          webpages are
          designed with a focus on simplicity, so that no extraneous information and functionality that might distract
          or confuse
          users appears. As the keystone of a web designer’s output is a site that wins and fosters the trust of the
          target audience, removing as many potential points of user frustration as possible is a critical consideration
        </p>

        <h2>Python</h2>
        <p>Python is a high-level programming language designed to be easy to read and
          simple to implement. It is open source, which means it is free to use, even
          for commercial applications. Python can run on Mac, Windows, and Unix
          systems and has also been ported to Java and .NET virtual machines. </p>

        <h2>C & C++</h2>
        <p>C is a high-level programming language that was developed in the mid-1970s. It was originally used for
          writing Unix programs, but is now
          used to write applications for nearly every available platform. Compared to most previous languages, C is
          easier to read, more flexible
          (can be used for a wide variety of purposes), and more efficient at using memory.</br>

          C++, pronounced "C plus plus," is a programming language that was built off the C language. The syntax of C++
          is nearly identical to C,
          but it has object-oriented features, which allow the programmer to create objects within the code. This makes
          programming easier, more efficient,
          and some would even say, more fun. Because of the power and flexibility of the language, most software
          programs today are written in C++.</p>

        <h2>Java</h2>
        <p>Java is a general-purpose, class-based, object-oriented programming language designed for having lesser
          implementation dependencies. It is a computing platform for application development. Java is fast, secure, and
          reliable, therefore. It is widely used for developing Java applications in laptops, data centers, game
          consoles, scientific supercomputers, cell phones, etc. </p>

        <h2>J.S.</h2>
        <p>JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages
          — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at —
          displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc.
          — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web
          technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning
          Area. </p>
